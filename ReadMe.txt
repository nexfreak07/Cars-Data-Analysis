I started this dataset and this is my first project after learning basic Pandas library.


It uses some of the basic questions related to -:

1. Data Cleaning 

Removal of NULL Values and putting a mean of respected coloumn if a NULL value is found.

2. Value Counts

Counting particular values.

3. Filtering

Here I filtered the dataset based on what is asked and then printing the whole dataset or the respected coloumn .

4. Removal of records

Removing records based on users choice and updating the dataset.

5. Updating value

Value is being updated to a particular coloumn using LAMBDA function

All these basic functions are used here to analyze the given data.
